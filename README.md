# 2017 AP CS Robocode Robot

## Movement
This robot uses Minimum Risk Movement. It creates n points in a radius r around the robot and evaluates each based on robot distance, robot energy, corner and center distance and last position offset.

## Shooting
Currently it uses Heads On Targeting but I will test it with circular targeting to test if it improves its score.
